	<p>
Penguins eat krill, squids, and fishes. Various species of penguins have slightly different food preferences, which reduce competition among species.

The smaller penguin species of the Antarctic and the subantarctic primarily feed on krill and squids. Species found farther north tend to eat fishes.
